# Robo R1 Toolbox
The goal of this repository is to make a quick access Archive of all the available files that you may need for your Robo R1, starting with the Firmwares so that you can update/edit your printers configuraion at will, or even find nifty upgrades for your Printer in one place and not have to worry about if the file was made for the R1 or R1+ varient! 

##Everything here is for the R1! This Github will not host files for the R1+!
